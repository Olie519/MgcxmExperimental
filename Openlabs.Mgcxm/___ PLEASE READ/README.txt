When you want to comment on a specific action / method, comment using this format:

// ==========================================================================
// {{current local time}} ({{date to your countrys standards}})
// Author: {{author}}
//
// {{message}}
// ==========================================================================

as this makes it much easier for the fellow programming community to notice your comment.
Comments can range to known bugs to just information about what your code does.

Remember: 
		Code is better when it is commented. 
		Do not leave others to guess what it does.
